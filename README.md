# GEEProcessess

## Overview  
**GEEProcessess** is a collection of **Google Earth Engine (GEE) scripts** for various remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and environmental monitoring projects. This repository serves as a reference for anyone looking to perform geospatial analysis using GEE, covering topics such as land cover classification, vegetation analysis, climate monitoring, and more.

## What You’ll Find Here  
This repository contains **GEE scripts** for different geospatial projects, including but not limited to:  
- **Land Cover Classification** (e.g., Sugarcane vs. Other Crops using SVM & RF)  
- **Vegetation Analysis** (NDVI, EVI, SAVI, etc.)  
- **Climate & Environmental Monitoring**  
- **Change Detection**  
- **Urban Expansion Analysis**  
- **Flood Mapping & Water Body Extraction**  

Each script is well-documented with step-by-step explanations, making it easy to understand and modify for your own projects.

## How to Use  
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KimutaiLawrence/GEEProcessess.git
   cd GEEProcessess

2. **Explore the scripts**

Each script is categorized based on the analysis type.
Open the .js files in Google Earth Engine Code Editor or a text editor of your choice.

3. **Run in Google Earth Engine**

Copy the script content and paste it into Google Earth Engine Code Editor.
Modify parameters as needed for your study area.
